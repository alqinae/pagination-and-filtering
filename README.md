# Pagination and Filtering:
- This project is about paginating and filtering a set of students data. It has a search field and page numbers buttons. 

- It is done by: **Khaled Alqenaei**, and I am looking forward to getting an **"Exceeds Expectation"** evaluation.

# To run this project:
1- Clone the project

2- Double-click on `index.html` to run it on your preferred web browser.

3- You can surf through the pages by clicking on the buttons in the footer.
Also, you can type any search phrase in the text field and the results will be filtered.
To reset the results, just delete the search phrase and you will get the full set of data.
